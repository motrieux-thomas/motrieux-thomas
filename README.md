ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m MOTRIEUX Thomas

As a digital enthusiast, I love giving life to the technical but also the visual aspect of a product.
My mantra is to emphasize the user experience and writing a clean code.

I consider programming to be a creative process. I enjoy using my creativity and skills to enhance the systems we operate in every day.
